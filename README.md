This project focuses on analyzing crowdfunding data to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights. 
Using Excel, I performed data cleaning and basic analysis, while SQL was employed to query and extract relevant data from the database. 
With Power BI and Tableau, I created interactive dashboards to visualize funding trends, campaign performance, and demographic insights. 
This analysis helps identify factors that influence crowdfunding success and drive better decision-making for campaign creators.
Attached are my work samples showcasing data analysis and visualization across various platforms. 
The Excel file includes detailed data cleaning and analysis, while the Power BI and Tableau dashboards demonstrate my ability to create interactive visualizations.
The PowerPoint presentation provides an overview of key insights and findings from these analyses.
